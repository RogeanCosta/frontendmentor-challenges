## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to insert images into the background, positioning them in the desired locations with background position.

```css
.body {
  background: url(../images/bg-pattern-top.svg) no-repeat top 200% left -45%, url(../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg)
      no-repeat bottom 250% right -35%, var(--dark-cyan);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about how to work with background styling, working with colors, gradients, images, maybe videos.

### Useful resources

- [Controlling background-images](https://youtu.be/3T_Jy1CqH9k) -
  This video by Kevin Powell helped me with the process of positioning the image in the background.
