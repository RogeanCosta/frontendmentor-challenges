## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to stretch the background image so that it is edge-to-edge using the background-size property.

```css
.body {
  background: url(../images/pattern-background-desktop.svg) no-repeat top, #e0e8ff;
  background-size: contain;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about flexbox, learning to determine when I should actually use it and when I shouldn't.
