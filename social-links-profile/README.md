## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to change cursor pointer to any image with cursor property:

```css
.element {
  cursor: url(../a_path/img.svg), auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I intend to continue improving my knowledge about building layouts with flexbox. I faced some problems with the links and I believe that a better understanding of flexbox could have helped me.
