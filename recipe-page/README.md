### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this exercise, I learned how to work with tables. Adding all the necessary structure to the HTML and styling it using CSS.

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Calories</th>
    <td>277kcal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Carbs</th>
    <td>0g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Protein</th>
    <td>20g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Fat</th>
    <td>22g</td>
  </tr>
</table>

```

### Continued development

I've been having some issues with table styling so I'd like to dedicate myself and learn more about how to do this.
