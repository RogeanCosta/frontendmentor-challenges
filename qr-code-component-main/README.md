## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Properties

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned and gained experience on how to use other people's designs to build something new. I was able to apply some of the knowledge I have to build this project and review it. It was really challenging to use what I know to build something new on my own, but I enjoyed it.
By the way, just a comment, I didn't need work with Media Queries,it already adjust automatically.

### Continued development

In futures projects, I'd like to focus in study about page layout, especially how to centralize a container, and about semantic HTML markup, such as article, main, footer.
I would like to study about accessibility too.
